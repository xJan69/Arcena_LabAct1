    <p>
        Hiding in the dark
        <br>
        Kept myself in silence for too long
        <br>
        Tried to rewrite all my wrongs
        <br>
        But everyday I'm feeling more anxious
        <br>
        <br>
        A puppet in a seat
        <br>
        Playing along with your symphony
        <br>
        Is that what you really want from me?
        <br>
        A voice throbbing deep in the sea
        <br>
        <br>
        Fall into oblivion
        <br>
        Forget about the innocence
        <br>
        I'll show you who I really am
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm not a part of your game
        <br>
        Stop pouring fuel to my rage
        <br>
        Don't think you're so hard to break
        <br>
        Come close to me, come close to me
        <br>
        <br>
        I freed myself from this chain
        <br>
        Now watch me rise and reclaim
        <br>
        Everything, I'm here to stay
        <br>
        Come close to me, come close to me
        <br>
        <br>
        I've been hiding in the dark quietly
        <br>
        Watch it all fall apart, tried to fix all my wrongs
        <br>
        But I don't know where to start
        <br>
        The atmosphere really tempts me
        <br>
        Must be something that I can't see
        <br>
        Though I'm not given the time, I'ma just show you my mind
        <br>
        <br>
        They say I'm a weirdo, I don't care though
        <br>
        'Cause I'd rather be on my own
        <br>
        And it's my throne, and it's my home
        <br>
        When the curtain calls, I'm in the zone, yeah
        <br>
        <br>
        You see that I'm ready
        <br>
        Chasing my dreams like I'm riding with Freddie
        <br>
        Your moment's coming, just make sure that you're ready
        <br>
        'Cause I'm better than I've ever been
        <br>
        Cue the confetti!
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm not a part of your game
        <br>
        Stop pouring fuel to my rage
        <br>
        Don't think you're so hard to break
        <br>
        Come close to me, come close to me
        <br>
        <br>
        I freed myself from this chain
        <br>
        Now watch me rise and reclaim
        <br>
        Everything, I'm here to stay
        <br>
        Come close to me, come close to me
        <br>
        <br>
        Come close to me
        <br>
        Come close to me
        <br>
        I'm not a part of your game
        <br>
        Stop pouring fuel to my rage
        <br>
        Don't think you're so hard to break
        <br>
        <br>
        (Let's go!)
        <br>
        I'm not a part of your game (part of your game)
        <br>
        Stop pouring fuel to my rage (rage)
        <br>
        Don't think you're so hard to break
        <br>
        Come close to me, come close to me
        <br>
        I freed myself from this chain (from this chain)
        <br>
        Now watch me rise and reclaim (reclaim)
        <br>
        Everything, I'm here to stay
        <br>
        Come close to me, come close to me
        <br>
        Come close to me
        <br>
        Come close to me
    </p>
